MISC
- Diffs: if a person adds a new line, the old line is considered to have the
  change (eg. a carriage return at the end of it).
	- If I move to splitlines() instead of splitting on \\n, the following
	  occurs due to the nature of unified_diff:
		- If text1 had an empty line and text2 filled that empty line, the
		  diff will consider that to be a new line. Therefore, when applied in
		  reverse, the text will be missing a line, and when applied forwards, it should
		  have an extra line.
		- This could be fixed if I wrote my own diff tool.
- The error page seems to mis-render the footer.
	- The CSS does not seem to be gettig pulled in.
- Entities and user relations are not rendering in a meaningful order. Need to
  find a better way to sort them.
