The Edit/Diff Problem
- If one person edits and another editor wants to edit, do they see the text
  with or without the first person's edits?

Idea: Editors edits automatically go through, meaning that two editors
separated in time will both be editing a full body of work without conflicts.

New (Smaller) Problem: If two people edit something at the same time, both
edits will be diffs of the same text. There could be conflicts.

Solution: Notify the second person that their work conflicts with that of
another editors.
- This can be done naively by checking the entity's text at the time of
  submission against the version that the latest edit points to. If they do not
match, there might be conflicts.
- Then immediately alert the second editor that their work could be
  conflicting, and that they need to review their changes.
	- In other words, the second editor does the manual merging!

Solution 2: Have editors 'check out' a section for editing.
- Projects would need to require a maximum amount of time for which an entity
  can be checked out.
- Other editors would have to be disallowed from editing while the entity is
  checked out.
	- Would the owner be able to add content while an editor has something
	  checked out?
		- Could allow editors to be warned when the owner wants to checkout
		  their own entity.
		- Can put up a JavaScript timer that lets people know that their
		  checkout time is running out.
		- When it runs out, what happens?

Possible Solutions
- Editors need to be disallowed from adding too much content.
	- Eg. they cannot add twice as many lines as they delete (in terms of
	  diffs).
