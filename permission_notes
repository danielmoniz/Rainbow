World - IN ORDER OF PERMISSIONS LEVELS
- Each World has a Founder. This is simply the person who created the World.
    - They cannot necessarily make executive decisions on everything, but they
      also cannot be banned from viewing the project. (Or something? This
      should be figured out.)
    - This need not even be displayed for a while, as in most cases the Founder
      will be the same as the owner.
    - The founder can always read all entities within their own.
- Each World has an Owner who can make executive decisions on everything within
  the World. This includes submitting and allowing new content, editing, and
  managing the positions of people within the World.
    - By default, this is the Worlds creator.
- Each World has some number of Chief Contributors, who can allow content to be
  submitted (stories, art, etc.). They can submit anything themselves, still
  subject to the editing process (but not the submission process; that is, they
  can ensure that something is submitted by skipping the veto process). They
  are in charge of all content within the World.
    - CCs can allow users to become World contributors or editors (subject to
      veto).
    - They can request that a user becomes a World CC, but cannot perform it
      themselves.
    - They can promote anyone to being CC of a Story (see Stories section).
    - There need not be any CCs.
- A World can have a number of editors. Editors can remove @edit status from
  any story within the World. They cannot, without further permissions, create
  their own stories, artwork, etc.
    - IMPORTANT: When working on a specific story, World Editors are outranked
      by the Author of the story and any Chief Contributors therein. Stalemate
      decisions are dealt with further down.
    - A NOTE ON EDITORS: All content, when submitted, is subject to editing. It
      is given the @edit tag or status. Editors can officially remove this
      status.
- Each World has some number of Contributors. A contributor is able to write
  new stories and add to existing ones, but all content has to be allowed.
    - World Contributors are considered to have approximately the same level of
      permissions as World Editors when it comes to conflicting jurisdiction in
      a Story.
    - There need not be any Contributors. A solo project would have no
      members of Contributor status.
- Worlds can have any number of Unsanctioned Contributors. This content can be
  accepted by a Chief Contributor, but they are under no obligation to do so.
    - Until such unrequested submissions are accepted, they are considered to
      be unedited Fan Fiction (or Fan Art).
    - Such submissions can be edited but not accepted, remaining Fan Fiction.

Story
- Each Story has an Author. This is simply the person who creates the Story.
    - They must be accepted by someone of proper permissions within the World.
    - The Author has FULL EXECUTIVE POWER when inside their own story. This
      means that they can decline any changes made by anyone. The situation
      where a higher-ranking member from the World makes a demand and has it
      refused by the Author is called a Stalemate Decision. This is dealt with
      further down.
- Each Story can have some number of Chief Contributors.
    - These are like World CCs, but their permissions extend only to this
      Story.
    - There need not be any Story CCs.
- A Story can have Editors. They are the same as World Editors, but they can
  only edit for this Story.
- Each Story has some number of Contributors. These are the same as world
  Contributors, but their permissions do not extend past this story.
    - There need not be any Contributors.
- A Story can have any number of Unsanctioned Contributors in the same way as a
  World.

Art, Music, and Other Media
- Art is Art. It therefore cannot be modified by anyone of a higher ranking
  than the artist. It can, however, be declined by such a member (eg. a World
  CC if submitting to the world in general, or an Author or Story CC if
  contributing to a specific Story.
- Art should (@TODO must?) be voted on.
    - @TODO Need to know exactly how voting should work!

Stalemate Decisions
- @TODO Need to decide whether or not the World Owner should get more say than
  the Author in an individual Story. OR, have it come down to a vote amongst
contributors or readers.
- A Stalemate Decision is when two people with executive power within a
  specific jurisdiction disagree. An obvious case is when a World CC or World
  Owner dislikes a portion of a specific Story, authored by a separate Author.
  This must be resolved by the World Owner and the Story Author. Either the story
  is disabled (not deleted; never deleted!), or the Author gets what they want.
  The Story cannot be moved away from the World (@TODO What is preventing a user
  from copying the Story and starting it elsewhere?).
